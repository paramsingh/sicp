;;; Exercise 3.1: An accumulator is a procedure that is called
;;; repeatedly with a single numeric argument and accumulates its arguments into a sum.
;;; Each time it is called, it
;;; returns the currently accumulated sum. Write a procedure
;;; make-accumulator that generates accumulators, each maintaining an
;;; independent sum.ÓÅâe input to make-accumulator
;;; should specify the initial value of the sum
